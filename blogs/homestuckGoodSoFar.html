            <h2> Homestuck Has Been Good So Far, Actually
            <h3> Posted October 31st, 2025</h3>
          <p>Yes so there's Reading Counter on this site, Yes i'm currently reading homestuck!<br><br>

When I'm done reading homestuck it'll probably be a mainstay reading counter, i wanna read more ! (That'll probably be another blog at one point...) <br><br>

Right now i'm around 50% of the way done with homestuck, page wise. i'm probably a lot less if you account for the amount of flash games that show up much more frequently and for longer in the newer pages compared to the older ones, but it's still a nice marker of where i'm at! <br><br>

Something i didn't realize I would be giving praise for though, is the writing and story so far. It's so nice to see everything move together, like setting up the 4 way combo (Where making this happen) cliffhanger into resolution, the music of course is a banger (thank you toby 'don't call me radiation' fox and the other artists), and (for the most part) the dialogue and characterizations. There are a few.... Hussieisms, as i like to call it (which  I'm not sure is the right phrase cause i only just used it now but we're sticking with it) that stick out like a sore thumb, but genuinely the writing and story has kept me 'One more page'ing  for hours on end. <br><br>

I never finished homestuck in it's hayday, getting to the beginning of act 6 before it slipped from my  hands for another obsession back in like 2014, but even then i always thought people who skipped the first 4 acts were missing out on what's going on . Even though 10 years passsed in the way 10 years do, I still keep that sentiment, because wow are so many things set up in the first 4 acts, it's absolutely insane how much you'd miss out. <br><br>

It might either just be a ... vizieism, or maybe a (bad) decision made for the trailer, but having John curse so much felt super off. He's not one to curse he's one to hehe and be a dumbass with an embodiment of hope, and though i liked how nice they kept to the art style, and moving the pesterlogs to calls (though I wonder how that's gonna work when we're in the part of not knowing who the trolls are), i didn't like dave's attitude, he's much more chillax than that whilst being super ironic, cause his personality is bound by the layers he wraps himself in. a fuckin irony burrito and he's the main filling. If he's still that outgoing the entire time, i do fear when we see times of going between dave and karkat. <br><br>

Overall though, i'm excited to keep delving into this project and reading, i hope the animation actually goes well. <br><br> </p>
